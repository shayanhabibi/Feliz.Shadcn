# Feliz.RadixUI

> [!NOTE]
> This is a Fable compiler binding.

This is an interface library which provides the prop primitives for RadixUI to enable users to create their own component libraries using the primitives.

The library is autogenerated from the docs. See the source for the generator.

# Install

First add the package dependency

---

### Nuget

```
dotnet add package Feliz.RadixUI.Interface 
```

### Paket

```
paket add package Feliz.RadixUI.Interface
```

---

You can then use the property bindings.

> [!WARNING]
> Whatever properties you inherit, you will have to ensure you have installed the npm dependencies.
> Alternatively, use femto to have them all installed for you

### Femto

> [!WARNING]
> Using Femto will automatically `npm` all radix-ui components. Use another method if you want to incrementally adopt them.

```
femto install Feliz.RadixUI.Interface
```
# Usage

> [!NOTE]
> The example usage demonstrates component specific typing.
> This is a preference, you can inherit the properties anyway you wish following the same pattern.

Say you are creating a component which depends on `@radix-ui/react-accordion` and you want to inherit the props for the `Root` object:

```fsharp
module Feliz.Accordion

open Feliz.RadixUI.Interface

type [<Erase>] IAccordionProp = interface end
type [<Erase>] accordion =
    // Inherit properties from RadixUI Accordion root
    inherit Accordion.root<IAccordionProp>
    // Define other properties here
    // If you have no further properties to add, add a dummy
    static member private inline noop = ()

// Start using RadixUI properties!
accordion.collapsible true
accordion.asChild true
// Feliz props are already interfaced!
accordion.children [ ]
```

# Feliz Properties

The RadixUI properties inherently interface with the standard set of Feliz props for convenience.
