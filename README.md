# Feliz.Shadcn

In development personal bindings to Shadcn components in Feliz style.

> [!WARNING]
> Not usable as it stands.

I have found the generator from Feliz.RadixUI to be unfavourable in the end-user experience. I favour the user experience
from ui libraries like FS.FluentUI instead and will probably have to suck it up and hand roll the bindings.
